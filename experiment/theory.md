### Introduction:

Cyclic voltammetry is an electroanalytical technique. It is a valuable technique that provides vital information about the oxidation state of an element in a compound. Various inorganic
compounds contain transition metal centers with different oxidation states. When conditions provide stable redox forms during the time required to obtain a voltammogram i.e. current-
potential curve. CV is a simple and direct method for measuring a complex<sup>s</sup> standard reduction potential (EÂ°). CV helps to determine the stability of a compound under different experimental
conditions. Ferrocene is a highly investigated organometallic molecule.Bis(cyclopentadienyl)iron(II) or ferrocene, Fe(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub> has a sandwich structure with the iron
sandwiched between two cyclopentadienyl rings.<br>

It can undergo one-electron oxidation to form ferrocenium cation Fe(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> reversibly. Organic
and aqueous mediums can be used to study ferrocene electrochemical behaviors.<br>
