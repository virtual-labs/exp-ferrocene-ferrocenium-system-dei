### Requirements:
Ferrocene, dichloromethane, tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate, sulfuric acid, ethanol.<b>
### Procedure: 
● Clean the electrodes and the electrochemical cell with double-distilled water.<b>
● The glassy carbon electrode is used as a working electrode, the saturated calomel electrode as a reference electrode, and the platinum wire electrode as an auxiliary electrode.<b>
● For this experiment, prepare two solutions: solution A and solution B. <br>
● For solution A, weigh 0.018gm of ferrocene and 3.29gm of tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (Bu 4 NBF 4 ). <br>
● Transfer these salts to a clean 100ml volumetric flask and make up with dichloromethane (CH 2 Cl 2 ). <br>
● For solution B, in another 100ml volumetric flask, add 0.018gm of ferrocene, then use a pipette to add 1.76ml aqueous H 2 SO 4 , and make up to 100ml using ethanol. <br>
● Pour 10ml of solution A and solution B into the electrochemical cell, one after the other, then initiate the cyclic voltammetry measurement to record the CV curve. <br>
● Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) Parameters: <br>
● Initial Potential: 0.0 V <br>
● Final Potential: 0.6 V <br>
● Scan Rate: 10 mV/s <br>
● Quiet Time (Equilibration Time): 5–10 s <br>
● Sweep Segments: 2 <br>
● Graphs A and B represent a glassy carbon electrode voltammetry of ferrocene in an organic medium and an aqueous medium. <br>
