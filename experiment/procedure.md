### Procedure:


●	Clean the electrodes and electrochemical cell with double distilled water.
<br>
●	The glassy carbon electrode is used as a working electrode, the saturated calomel electrode as a reference electrode, and the platinum wire electrode as an auxiliary electrode.
<br>
●	Prepare two solutions, for solution A weigh 0.018gm of ferrocene and 3.29gm of Bu<sub>4</sub>NBF<sub>4</sub>.
<br>
●	Transfer both these salts to a clean 100ml volumetric flask and makeup to 100ml using CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>. 
<br>
●	For solution B, in another 100ml volumetric flask add 0.018gm of ferrocene, use a pipette to add 1.76ml aqueous H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> , and makeup to 100ml using ethanol.
<br>
●	Pour 10ml of solution A and solution B into the electrochemical cell, one after the other to obtain the CV graph.
<br>
●	The graph represents a glassy carbon electrode voltammetry of ferrocene in an organic medium and aqueous medium.
